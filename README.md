Nix AmigaOS environment
=======================
This package contains a Nix function that automatically builds AmigaOS software
using Geek Gadgets, a GNU build tool chain ported to AmigaOS, and UAE, the
Ultimate Amiga Emulator.

Furthermore, it includes several example cases demonstrating its use.

Examples
========

* GNU Hello, the trivial example case from the GNU project
* `hello-intuition`, a very trivial native AmigaOS application opening an intuition window displaying a friendly greeting
* [wavepak](http://aminet.net/package/mus/misc/wavepak), is a freeware utility, which can encode and decode 8SVX samples using a fibonacci or exponential-delta method
